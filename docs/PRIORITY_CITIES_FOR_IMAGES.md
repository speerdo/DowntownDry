## How to Find Wikipedia Images

1. Go to Wikipedia and search for the city (e.g., "Lakewood, Ohio")
2. Look for a cityscape or landmark image
3. Click on the image to see its full size
4. Right-click and select "Copy image address"
5. Use the full-resolution URL (usually ends with something like `/2560px-CityName.jpg`)

## Example URL Format
```
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/[hash]/[filename]/2560px-[filename].jpg
```

Or without thumbnail sizing:
