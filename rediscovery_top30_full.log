   [1/6] Killer Whale Sex Club
      ❌ Killer Whale Sex Club is a high-volume cocktail bar in Phoenix known for its provocative name, loud music, and 'smutty' aesthetic (including polaroids on the walls). While it is currently operational (with Yelp updates and reviews extending into 2026), it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with three or more options, nor is it an alcohol-free or kava-based establishment. Search results regarding non-alcoholic options in Phoenix consistently recommend other nearby venues (like Lacuna Kava Bar) over this location, which is primarily focused on craft cocktails and a high-energy bar atmosphere.

   [6/6] The Social Ally
      ❌ The provided Google Places data and search results identify 'The Social Ally' (Social Ally Media) as a digital marketing and social media agency located in a Scottsdale office complex, rather than a hospitality venue. While the name appears in a Yelp SEO list for non-alcoholic drinks, there is no evidence of a physical storefront, a beverage menu, or any public-facing bar operations. It does not meet any of the eligibility criteria for a sober-friendly directory.

   [7/13] Juno
      ❌ The venue is currently listed as 'CLOSED_TEMPORARILY' in the Google Places data. Fresh search results from Yelp (updated January 2026) confirm this status, stating the venue is scheduled to reopen on April 24, 2026. While the venue would otherwise qualify as a sober-friendly establishment due to its documented mocktail menu and participation in 'Dry January' events (as cited by Main Line Parent and Aversa PR), the instructions require a 'false' qualification for any venue that is currently closed.

      ❌ Craft Hall is primarily a micro-brewery (home to Mainstay Independent Brewing) and a sports bar. While the search results highlight it as a 'family-friendly' venue with an indoor playground and arcade, there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options) or a specialized non-alcoholic beverage program. Search results for Philadelphia's zero-proof and mocktail scenes prominently feature other venues (like Bar Hygge and Bar Palmina) but do not list Craft Hall as a destination for non-drinkers. It does not meet the criteria for a dedicated NA bar, kava bar, or sober-friendly venue with prominent NA beverage options.

   [11/22] Jude's Old Town
      ❌ Jude's Old Town is a currently operational Cajun-influenced restaurant and craft cocktail bar. While the employee-owned team is highly active in the Seattle non-alcoholic scene—specifically opening a dedicated NA sister bar called 'Rosette' nearby in 2025—Jude's itself remains a traditional bar and restaurant. Search results and menu snippets only identify basic non-alcoholic options such as house-made ginger soda and do not provide evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with 3+ distinct options. Per the instructions, venues that are primarily regular bars with minimal NA options are rejected.

      ❌ Jupiter Bar is a traditional 21+ 'art bar' and arcade (barcade) located in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood. While it offers activities like pinball and arcade games which can be appealing to non-drinkers, the search results provide no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu or a specialized non-alcoholic beverage program. It is described as a 'dive bar' with a 'low-frills cocktail menu' and does not meet the criteria for a dedicated sober-friendly directory listing. Note: Search results mentioning a 'Jupiter' with a strong NA menu refer to a different venue in Portland, Oregon.

      ❌ Ondus on the Waterfront is a standard upscale restaurant and lounge located within the AC Hotel Vancouver Waterfront. While search results and social media mentions confirm the availability of 'zero proof' beverages, the venue is primarily a traditional dining establishment with a full bar and a heavy emphasis on cocktails and happy hour. It does not possess a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options prominently featured) or a specialized non-alcoholic identity that distinguishes it from a typical high-end hotel restaurant.

      ❌ According to multiple fresh search results from late 2025 and early 2026 (Willamette Week, OregonLive, and Yelp), Cliffs PDX officially closed on December 31, 2025. The closure was due to the landlord (The Wonder Ballroom) declining to renew the lease. While the venue was previously highly regarded for its 'Zero Proof' menu and mocktails, it is no longer an active establishment.

      ❌ While Bittercube Apothecary is currently operational as a production facility and retail storefront, it no longer functions as a social venue or bar. Search results confirm that the 'Bittercube Bar' and its sister speakeasy 'Mosler's Vault' closed permanently in September 2024 following the closure of the North Avenue Market. The remaining Apothecary location on Lisbon Ave is a retail shop selling bitters, syrups, and NA ingredients with limited daytime hours (Tuesday-Friday, 12 PM - 6 PM), rather than a bar or lounge serving prepared mocktails for on-site consumption.

While Yelp mentions 'Non Alcoholic Drinks' as a category tag, there is no evidence in the search results of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options) or a specific focus on being a sober-friendly establishment. As it is primarily a standard cocktail bar, it does not meet the eligibility criteria.

   [8/12] Feast
      ❌ Feast is a highly-rated restaurant that is currently operational, with active events and reviews through early 2026. However, it does not meet the criteria for DowntownDry. Its beverage program is heavily focused on alcohol, specifically featuring a substantial wine list, monthly wine dinners, and wine tasting events. Search results for non-alcoholic options in Tucson (such as Tucson Foodie's Dry January guide) list several other venues but do not mention Feast as having a dedicated mocktail menu or a specialized non-alcoholic program. Without evidence of at least three prominently featured mocktails or a dedicated sober-friendly focus, it remains a standard restaurant with a primary emphasis on wine culture.

   [10/12] R Bar
      ❌ R Bar is the official bar of the Rialto Theatre in Tucson. While it is currently operational (with active events and reviews through early 2026), it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory. The venue's own website and descriptions focus exclusively on 'creative cocktails, an expansive beer selection, and an adventurous wine selection.' There is no evidence in the search results of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), kava service, or a specific focus on non-alcoholic offerings. It is categorized primarily as a standard bar and nightlife establishment.
   [11/12] BATA

   [12/12] Cruda Mariscos
      ❌ CRUDA Mariscos & Oyster Bar is a standard seafood restaurant and bar that serves alcohol, including wine and beer-based micheladas. While search results mention the availability of non-alcoholic beverages in a general sense, there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with three or more options, nor is there any indication of kava or specialized zero-proof offerings. The venue primarily functions as a traditional oyster bar and does not feature the prominent non-alcoholic programming required for inclusion in the directory.

      ❌ Junction West has transitioned from a public-facing bar to a private event and wedding venue. While the establishment maintains a dedicated non-alcoholic menu featuring multiple mocktails (such as 'Forbin's Ascent' and 'Famous Mockingbird'), the official website now explicitly states it is 'Open By Appointment Only' for weddings and corporate events. Local community discussions on Reddit from late 2024 confirm this change, with residents expressing that they 'miss' the space as a public venue. Since it is no longer accessible to the general public for walk-in service, it does not meet the criteria for a public directory.

   [1/18] Legally Different
      ❌ The provided search results do not contain evidence of a physical venue currently operating under the name 'Legally Different.' The only mentions of this name are found in a Facebook comment from 2023. The Google Places data provided is for a business called 'OMG Everything' at 1818 Atlantic Ave, which is categorized as a general store/souvenir shop with no mention of non-alcoholic bar features, mocktail menus, or kava. Furthermore, search results for the venue are dominated by 'Legal Sea Foods,' a separate entity that is permanently closed. Without evidence of a dedicated non-alcoholic menu or active operations in 2025-2026, the venue does not qualify.
   [2/18] Space Coast Kava Community
      ❌ The venue 'Space Coast Kava Community' does not exist in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The 'Space Coast' is a geographic region in Florida (Brevard County), and search results confirm this entity is a Facebook community group and former physical location (Outpost Kava) based in Melbourne, Florida. Furthermore, the provided Google Places data is for 'CAVA,' a Mediterranean restaurant chain, which is a common search mismatch for the word 'Kava.' There is no evidence of a physical kava bar by this name operating in the Virginia Beach area.

   [8/18] The Hunt Room
      ❌ The Hunt Room is a traditional 'hunting tavern' and bourbon bar located within the Historic Cavalier Hotel. While it is a highly-rated restaurant, its primary focus is on 'proper cocktails' and bourbon flights. Search results for mocktails at this location are discouraging; a specific Yelp snippet from a user looking for zero-proof options noted that the bartender did not have or make them. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with 3+ options, and the venue's identity is centered around a historic distillery and spirit-heavy atmosphere, making it a poor fit for a sober-specific directory.

   [11/18] Waterman's Surfside Grille
      ❌ Waterman's Surfside Grille is a well-established seafood restaurant and bar that is open and operational, with reviews and website data extending into early 2026. However, it does not qualify for a sober-friendly directory because it is primarily a traditional bar environment famous for being the 'Original Crush House'—the birthplace of the vodka-based Orange Crush cocktail. While the venue is family-friendly and uses fresh-squeezed juices, there is no evidence in the search results of a dedicated mocktail menu with three or more options, nor is it marketed as a sober-friendly or non-alcoholic destination. It falls under the red flag category of being primarily a regular bar/restaurant with standard NA options (soda/juice) rather than a specialized mocktail or alcohol-free program.

   [18/18] Breakfast Bar
      ❌ Breakfast Bar is a Hispanic-fusion restaurant that is currently operational, with reviews as recent as January 2026. While local social media mentions a 'selection of nonalcoholic drinks' and 'virgin' options (such as non-alcoholic coquito), the venue's own website and marketing prominently feature 'tropical mimosas' as a primary attraction. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with three or more options, nor does it function as a specialized alcohol-free or kava establishment. It is a standard restaurant that serves alcohol, and its non-alcoholic offerings do not appear prominent enough to meet the directory's specific eligibility criteria.

   [5/22] Grails Miami
      ❌ Grails Miami is primarily a high-energy sports bar and restaurant centered around its 'sneaker cocktails,' beer buckets, and 70+ TVs for sports viewing. While it is a popular dining spot, the search results and menu snippets do not provide evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options) or a specialized non-alcoholic program. It appears in some Yelp search results for kava or hookah, but these are generic SEO lists of Miami venues rather than an indication of its primary offerings. As a standard sports bar with a heavy emphasis on alcohol-based 'vessel drinks,' it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory.

   [10/22] Il Giardino
      ❌ The venue at 1236 Ocean Dr (Miami Beach) is an operational restaurant and bar. While it is currently open (with reviews extending into 2026), it does not meet the eligibility criteria for DowntownDry. Search results describe it as a typical Ocean Drive establishment featuring '2-for-1' alcoholic drink specials and nightlife entertainment such as dancers. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), kava service, or a specific non-alcoholic focus. Note: A different 'Il Giardino' location in Coconut Grove offers high tea and matcha, but the specific venue provided in the Google Places data is the Ocean Drive location.
   [11/22] Chotto Matte
      ❌ Chotto Matte Miami closed its doors on August 10, 2024. While the official website and some news reports initially cited 'renovations' or 'refurbishment,' multiple search results and social media reports from late 2024 and throughout 2025 indicate the venue has not reopened, with some sources reporting the closure as permanent. Because the venue is not currently operational, it does not qualify for the directory.

While search results mention a 'juice menu' that can be ordered without alcohol, there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail or zero-proof menu featuring 3+ prominently listed options. As it is a regular establishment with a full bar and no specialized non-alcoholic focus, it does not meet the criteria for the directory.

While the venue is currently operational (with active social media posts as of early 2026), it does not meet the criteria for DowntownDry. Search results specifically targeting non-alcoholic and mocktail menus for this venue failed to produce any evidence of a dedicated NA program or a mocktail menu with 3+ options. Instead, the venue is consistently described as a 'cocktail bar' focused on Miami's 'nightlife scene.' Although it appears in Yelp lists alongside kava bars, it is categorized as a standard bar and does not serve kava or focus on sober-friendly offerings.

      ❌ Macchialina is a highly acclaimed Italian restaurant that is currently operational, with search results and reviews extending into 2026. However, it does not qualify for the directory because its beverage program is heavily centered on alcohol. It recently received a Michelin Guide Sommelier Award (2025) for its extensive Italian wine list, and its new internal concept, Fluke, is specifically branded as a 'Martini & Crudo Bar.' There is no evidence in the search results of a dedicated mocktail menu with three or more options, nor is the venue marketed as a sober-friendly or non-alcoholic destination.

While search results indicate it is currently operational (with reviews and social media activity extending into 2025 and 2026), it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory. The venue primarily focuses on alcoholic beers, spirits, and cocktails.

It functions as a standard bar and production facility.

      ❌ The Dan is a 1920s-themed restaurant and speakeasy located within the Hotel Flor Tampa. While search results confirm the venue is currently operational with active reviews and social media posts through January 2026, it does not meet the eligibility criteria for the directory. The establishment's primary focus is on its 'old school speakeasy' atmosphere and cocktail program. There is no evidence in the provided search results of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), kava service, or a specialized non-alcoholic program that distinguishes it as a specifically sober-friendly destination.
   [11/16] Reboot
      ❌ The venue at the provided address (2202 N Westshore Blvd Suite 200) is located in a corporate office building and is categorized in Google Places data as a 'health' establishment, which does not meet the criteria for a hospitality or social venue. While there is a 'Reboot Arcade & Bar' in the nearby Dunedin area, search results (BeerMenus) indicate its non-alcoholic offerings are limited to standard sodas and Red Bull, which does not satisfy the requirement for a dedicated mocktail menu or a specialized sober-friendly environment.

Multiple search results, including Apple Maps and local news reports, confirm the venue is shuttered under its original name.

It is primarily marketed as a 'premier circular cocktail bar' with a focus on spirits, tequilas, and 'crafted cocktails.' While one search result mentions a single 'zero-proof cocktail' offered during a specific 2024 event, there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options) or prominent non-alcoholic features. It remains a standard, alcohol-focused cocktail lounge.

      ❌ Based on the search results, 'Mocktail Bar NJ' (associated with mocktailsmagic.com) is a mobile alcohol-free catering service for events and offices rather than a physical brick-and-mortar venue. The Google Places data provided for the Newark location points to 'Consigliere,' which is a standard cocktail bar. There is no evidence in the search results that Consigliere features a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), a kava offering, or a THC lounge setup. As a mobile service and a standard bar respectively, neither entity meets the criteria for a physical sober-friendly venue listing.

While search results mention a 'West End Trading Co.' (202 S Sanford Ave) in the same city that features a 'Cali Sober' mocktail menu and a dedicated non-alcoholic beverage program, there is no evidence in the provided results that the Theater establishment itself offers a dedicated mocktail menu or prominent NA options.

It functions primarily as a traditional high-end cocktail lounge and does not meet the criteria for a sober-specific directory.
   [9/10] Siren Spirits
      ❌ Siren Spirits (Orlando) is a mobile bartending and event service rather than a physical venue. Search results from The Knot and the business's official website (orlandopartybartender.com) confirm it is a 'mobile wedding bartending company' that provides services for private parties. While they offer dedicated mocktail packages and are highly rated for their non-alcoholic options at events, they do not operate a permanent, public-facing storefront or lounge for the general public to visit. The address listed on Yelp (10530 Larson Ct) is located in a residential area, further confirming its status as a home-based mobile operation.

There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), kava service, or specific sober-friendly features that would distinguish it from a standard bar. While one Reddit snippet mentions NA options in a list, the context is ambiguous and refers to a different location ('Washington Heights'), whereas this venue is in Mount Washington, Pittsburgh.

Additionally, their primary business model involves mobile bars for weddings and corporate events where the client often provides the alcohol, making it a service provider rather than a sober-friendly destination.

   [12/17] Brasserie
      ❌ While Brasserie by Niche is a highly-rated and operational restaurant in St. Louis (with reviews extending into 2026), it does not meet the criteria for a sober-specific directory. According to the provided 2025 menu, its non-alcoholic offerings are limited to standard sodas (Excel Soda), sparkling water, and a single alcohol-free wine option. While the brunch menu features a 'Nomosa,' there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail program with three or more crafted zero-proof cocktails, which is required for the 'mocktail_bar' or 'sober_friendly' designation.

   [17/17] STL Herbs And Aromatics
      ❌ STL Herbs and Aromatics is a retail apothecary and herbalist shop rather than a social venue or beverage establishment. While it is a 100% alcohol-free environment and sells bulk herbs such as kava root and loose-leaf tea, it functions strictly as a retail store for wellness products and ingredients. There is no evidence of a bar, cafe, or lounge setup where prepared drinks are served for on-site consumption, which is a primary requirement for the directory.

Search results and Google data indicate it is currently 'closed for the season' or 'temporarily closed.' Furthermore, it is primarily an alcohol-focused establishment described as a 'party scene' after dark. While it mentions serving non-alcoholic drinks, there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with 3+ options or a specific focus on sober-friendly programming that would distinguish it from a standard bar.

   [12/15] Driftwood Cafe
      ⚠️ Gemini network error, retrying in 2s... (attempt 1/5)
      ❌ There are two 'Driftwood' establishments in St. Petersburg. The venue at the provided address (800 2nd Ave NE) is the Driftwood Cafe located at the St. Pete Pier. Search results and menu descriptions indicate this is a standard cafe serving coffee, ice cream, and snacks, but it also serves 'boozy' (alcoholic) beverages, meaning it is not alcohol-free. While its sister venues in the same building (Teak and Pier Teaki) offer mocktails, the cafe itself focuses on standard cafe fare. It is not a kava bar; the kava-focused business (Driftwood Kava & Coffee Roastery) is a separate entity located on Central Avenue. Because it serves alcohol and lacks a dedicated, prominent mocktail or kava program, it does not meet the directory's specific eligibility criteria.
   [13/15] Teak
      ✅ QUALIFIED
   ✨ Enriching: Teak
   [14/15] Pier Teaki
      ❌ Pier Teaki is a high-volume, rum-focused rooftop tiki bar. While search results and the venue's website mention that mocktails are available and they offer non-alcoholic beer, they do not meet the eligibility criteria for a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ prominently featured options). Local search results from 2024 and 2025 indicate that patrons must 'ask the bartender directly' for mocktails rather than choosing from a curated zero-proof menu. As the venue's primary identity is a traditional bar and nightlife destination, it does not qualify for the directory.

   [6/12] Texas Cafe & Bar
      ❌ Texas Cafe & Bar (locally known as 'The Spoon') is a traditional Lubbock establishment focused on barbecue, pizza, live music, and standard bar service. While it is an operational restaurant, search results and the venue's own website provide no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu, kava, or specialized non-alcoholic beverage program. It is notably absent from local 'Mocktail Trail' and 'Zero-Proof' guides for Lubbock, which highlight other area venues with prominent sober-friendly options.
   [7/12] Cujo's Sports Bar & Grill
      ❌ Cujo's Sports Bar & Grill is a traditional sports tavern and dive bar. While it is currently operational (with search results and reviews updated as recently as January 2026), it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory. The venue's own marketing and third-party descriptions focus heavily on 'daily drink specials,' 'happy hour,' and its status as a dive bar. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu, kava service, or specialized non-alcoholic beverage program beyond standard soft drinks.

   [9/12] Caprock Cafe
      ❌ Caprock Cafe is a traditional bar and grill that explicitly markets itself with the slogan 'Cold Beer, Big Burgers, Hot Music!' and has been voted 'Best Place to Have a Beer.' Search results and official menus show no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu, kava, or specialized non-alcoholic beverage program. It is primarily a regular bar/restaurant and does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory.
   [10/12] Shotzy's Bar & Grill
      ❌ Shotzy's Bar & Grill is a traditional bar and restaurant that does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory. While it is a smoke-free environment and appears in some local lists of places that offer non-alcoholic options, its primary identity and marketing revolve around alcohol culture. The venue features a 'Shot Wheel' and promotes happy hour specials for beers and wells. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with three or more options; search results only mention general 'non-alcoholic options' or inclusion in broad lists of bars that can accommodate non-drinkers. The 'Shotzy's' branding and focus on shots represent a significant red flag for a sober-specific directory.

   [3/14] Hell or High Water
      ❌ Hell or High Water is a traditional high-end speakeasy and cocktail bar primarily focused on bourbon and craft spirits. While search results from 2025 and 2026 confirm it is currently operational (including a live jazz schedule through March 2026), there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu with three or more options. Mentions of non-alcoholic options are limited to a single 'ginger drink' in a 2022 Reddit thread and a seasonal 'House Hot Cocoa' during a holiday pop-up. As it lacks prominent, dedicated non-alcoholic features, it does not meet the criteria for the directory.
   [4/14] Chateau Bourbon
      ❌ Chateau Bourbon is a luxury Bed and Breakfast that is explicitly themed around bourbon culture and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. While it is a highly-rated operational venue with recent 2025 reviews, its core identity is the opposite of a sober-friendly destination; the venue advertises 'welcome cocktails' and 'bourbon-themed breakfasts' where they incorporate alcohol into house specialty dishes like granola. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu or specialized non-alcoholic program that would meet the directory's eligibility criteria.

Furthermore, its own social media marketing as recently as January 2026 uses slogans like 'Drink MORE. Drink EARLIER,' which is inconsistent with a sober-friendly or non-alcoholic focused establishment. It is primarily a regular bar with minimal NA options.

   [11/18] Volstead
      ❌ Volstead Act is a traditional 21+ cocktail bar that is currently operational, with reviews and website updates extending into early 2026. While the venue is highly regarded for its seasonal 'Miracle' holiday pop-up which features a dedicated zero-proof cocktail menu, it does not meet the criteria for a permanent listing. Search results, including a TripAdvisor review from 2026, explicitly state that there are no non-alcoholic options listed on the standard year-round menu. Although bartenders are noted as being helpful and willing to 'whip up' custom drinks upon request, the lack of a prominent, dedicated NA menu (3+ options) during regular operations falls under the red flag of being a regular bar with minimal NA visibility.
   [12/18] Purgatory Craft Beer And Whiskey Bar
      ❌ Purgatory Craft Beer and Whiskey Bar is primarily a traditional alcohol-focused establishment, explicitly marketing its collection of over 1,000 bottles of whiskey and extensive craft beer selection. While it offers a full food menu and is highly rated as a restaurant, there is no evidence in the search results of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options) or a specific focus on non-alcoholic offerings. It falls under the red flag of being primarily a regular bar where the identity is centered around spirits and beer.
   [13/18] Mootsy's
      ❌ Mootsy's is a traditional dive bar in Spokane with a 'punk rock Americana' atmosphere. While search results indicate they stock a few non-alcoholic canned options (such as Athletic IPA and Lagunitas Hoppy Refresher), there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu or specialized zero-proof program. The venue is primarily known for 'stiff drinks,' live music, and a late-night bar scene, which falls under the red flag of being a regular bar with minimal NA options rather than a dedicated sober-friendly destination.
   [14/18] Lions Lair
      ❌ Lions Lair is a traditional high-energy nightclub and bar in Spokane known for EDM music, dancing, and drag shows. While some search results from local Facebook groups mention it in lists of bars that can provide mocktails, there is no evidence of a dedicated non-alcoholic menu with three or more options. One search result mentioning kava and botanical beverages appears to be a misattributed snippet from a different venue (likely Celestial Beans) appearing in the same list. As a primary nightlife and alcohol-focused establishment, it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory.

      ❌ The venue provided in the Google Places data is 'So Bar Richmond' located in the United Kingdom, which is a standard cocktail bar and restaurant, not a sober-specific establishment. There is no evidence in the search results of a venue named 'The Sobar' or 'So Bar' in Richmond, Virginia. Furthermore, search results for Richmond, Virginia, indicate that the city's only dedicated non-alcoholic bar, KavaClub, closed permanently on June 30, 2025. Because the provided location data refers to a regular bar in another country and the only relevant sober venue in the target city is shuttered, this venue does not qualify.

While the venue is currently operational (with active mentions in late 2025 and early 2026), it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), kava service, or an alcohol-free mission. It is primarily marketed as a 'Wine Lounge & Craft Cocktail Bar' and a venue for sports-related events, which falls under the 'primarily a regular bar' red flag.
   [9/14] Wonderland
      ❌ Wonderland is a well-established horror-themed bar in Richmond's Shockoe Bottom.

It is primarily a regular bar and nightclub; search results indicate the lead bartender does not use a set cocktail menu, and there is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options) or specialized non-alcoholic focus. It is frequently mentioned alongside KavaClub in search results, but they are distinct entities, with the latter being the dedicated non-alcoholic kava bar in the area.

   [1/12] Sober AF Zero Proof
      ✅ QUALIFIED
   ✨ Enriching: Sober AF Zero Proof
   [2/12] Aafiya Lounge
      ❌ Aafiya Lounge does not currently qualify as a physical venue. Search results and the founder's LinkedIn profile indicate that it is currently operating as an event mocktail catering service rather than a brick-and-mortar lounge. While there are documented plans to open a physical non-alcoholic venue in Tacoma in the future, there is no evidence of a current operational address for public walk-ins. Furthermore, the Google Places data provided in the request actually refers to a different business, 'Side Pony Lounge,' which is a standard bar.

   [8/12] Top of Tacoma
      ❌ Top of Tacoma is a well-known neighborhood bar and cafe that remains operational as of early 2026. While it is highly rated for its food and atmosphere, search results indicate its non-alcoholic offerings are limited to standard items like Bedford's ginger beer. It does not have a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options) or a specialized non-alcoholic program. It is primarily a traditional bar environment and does not meet the 'prominent NA options' threshold required for inclusion in a sober-specific directory.
   [9/12] The Old Hang Out
      ❌ The Old Hang Out is a tiki bar and restaurant located within the McMenamins Elks Temple in Tacoma. While search results confirm the venue is operational with data extending into early 2026, it does not meet the eligibility criteria for the directory. The provided search results specifically targeting 'non-alcoholic menu' and 'mocktails' for this venue failed to return any evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu or prominent non-alcoholic beverage program. Instead, the results characterize it as a traditional cocktail-focused tiki bar. Without evidence of at least three featured mocktails or a specialized sober-friendly focus, it remains classified as a regular bar.

   [1/4] Crisp Rochester

   ✨ Enriching: Crisp Rochester
   [2/4] Martine Kocktails
      ❌ Martine is a cocktail bar in Rochester's South Wedge neighborhood that specializes in 'kocktails,' a term the owners use to refer to cocktails served on draft (kegs). While the venue is operational and highly rated as of early 2026, it does not meet the criteria for a sober-friendly directory. Local search results and community discussions (Reddit 2024-2025) specifically note that the bar's focus on pre-mixed draft cocktails makes it a less ideal choice for non-drinkers compared to other local venues. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu featuring three or more options; rather, the venue is consistently described as a 'potent' and 'great cocktail bar' for traditional drinkers.

   [1/6] Red Bluff Bar
      ✅ QUALIFIED
   ✨ Enriching: Red Bluff Bar
   [2/6] Leroy
      ❌ Leroy is a well-established cocktail lounge and craft beer bar. While it is highly rated for its mixology and atmosphere, the search results focus exclusively on its alcoholic offerings, including an 'unmatched beer selection,' tiki cocktails, and 'beermosas.' There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), kava, or other non-alcoholic specialties that would distinguish it as a sober-friendly destination beyond being a standard high-end bar.
   [3/6] Taste
      ❌ Taste is a wine bar and tapas restaurant located in the Hampstead area of Montgomery. While the venue is currently operational (with reviews and updates extending into 2026), it does not meet the criteria for DowntownDry. The search results and the business's own descriptions emphasize wine flights, craft beer, and traditional happy hours. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu (3+ options), kava service, or a specific focus on non-alcoholic offerings. As a venue primarily identified as a wine bar, it does not qualify as a specialized sober-friendly destination.
   [4/6] Bad Daddy's Burger Bar
      ✅ QUALIFIED
   ✨ Enriching: Bad Daddy's Burger Bar
   [5/6] Bar Attico
      ❌ Bar Attico is a traditional rooftop cocktail bar and lounge focused primarily on 'funk wines' and handcrafted alcoholic cocktails. While it is currently operational (with active social media and reviews through early 2026), it does not meet the eligibility criteria for a sober-friendly directory. Specifically, search results from Yelp indicate that the venue does not have a dedicated menu for non-alcoholic drinks, and its primary identity is that of a standard high-end bar/nightlife spot.
   [6/6] Mingles Lounge
      ❌ Mingles Lounge is consistently categorized as a standard bar, nightclub, and nightlife venue in Montgomery. Search results and Google Places data identify it as a 'bar' with a focus on sports and nightlife. There is no evidence of a dedicated mocktail menu, kava service, or any specific non-alcoholic programming that would distinguish it as a sober-friendly destination beyond a typical bar setting.
