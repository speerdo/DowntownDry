          <p class="mb-4">
            Welcome to Downtown Dry. These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to your use of our website at downtowndry.bar (the "Site"). By browsing or using the Site, you're agreeing to follow these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that doesn't work for you, we understand, but please don't continue using the Site.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">2. What Downtown Dry Does</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We built Downtown Dry to make it easier to find great places to go out that don't revolve around alcohol. That means kava bars, mocktail spots, THC beverage lounges, and other alcohol-free venues across the country.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">Here's what we offer on the Site:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>A searchable directory of alcohol-free venues</li>
            <li>Blog posts and guides about kava, THC drinks, and the alcohol-free lifestyle</li>
            <li>Links to third-party retailers who sell alcohol-free products</li>
            <li>A newsletter for community updates and new venue announcements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We're a directory and resource — not a venue operator, retailer, or healthcare provider.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">Pretty straightforward stuff. When you use our Site, you agree to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Give us accurate info when submitting a venue or filling out a contact form</li>
            <li>Use the Site for lawful purposes only</li>
            <li>Not mess with or try to break the Site's functionality</li>
            <li>Not scrape, copy, or republish our content without getting our okay first</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You're also responsible for following any applicable local, state, and federal laws while using the Site.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">4. You Must Be 21 or Older</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Because our Site covers venues that may serve kava, THC-infused beverages, and other products meant for adults, we require all users to be at least 21 years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using this Site, you're confirming that you meet that age requirement.
          </p>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">5. About Our Venue Listings</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We do our best to keep venue info current, but things change. A bar might update its hours, swap out its menu, or close its doors without telling us. So keep the following in mind:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>We can't guarantee that every listing is 100% accurate or complete</li>
            <li>Hours, menus, and availability can shift at any time</li>
            <li>It's always a good idea to call or check a venue's own website before heading out</li>
            <li>We're not on the hook for your experience at any venue we list</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A listing on Downtown Dry isn't an endorsement — it just means the venue fits our directory criteria.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">6. Health and Safety</h2>

            <h3 class="font-bold text-amber-800 mb-2">Read This Before You Go Out</h3>
            <p class="text-amber-700 mb-4">
              Nothing on this Site is medical advice. We write about kava, THC beverages, and alcohol-free alternatives because we think they're interesting and worth knowing about — but we're not doctors. Here's what you should know:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-amber-700 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Kava</strong> can interact with certain medications and may affect liver function. Talk to your doctor before trying it, and don't drive afterward.</li>
              <li><strong>THC beverages</strong> can impair your judgment, coordination, and reaction time. Don't drive or operate heavy machinery after drinking them. Effects typically last anywhere from 2 to 8 hours.</li>
              <li>If you're pregnant or nursing, avoid both kava and THC products.</li>
              <li>When in doubt, check with your healthcare provider before trying something new.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">7. Third-Party Links and Affiliates</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We link out to other websites from time to time — including Better Rhodes, one of our affiliate partners. When you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission. This is one of the ways we keep Downtown Dry running.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            A few things to be aware of:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>We don't control what third-party sites do with their products, content, or your data</li>
            <li>Those sites have their own terms and privacy policies — read them</li>
            <li>Our affiliate partnerships have zero bearing on which venues we list or how we rank them</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">

          <p class="mb-4">
            When you send us a venue tip, feedback, or any other content, you're giving Downtown Dry a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, edit, publish, and share that content as part of running our services.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent the law allows, Downtown Dry isn't liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages that come from using (or being unable to use) this Site.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">11. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            If your use of the Site (or a violation of these Terms) leads to a legal claim against us, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Downtown Dry — along with our team members, officers, and agents — from any resulting damages, losses, or expenses.

          <p class="mb-4">
            We might revise these Terms from time to time. When we make meaningful changes, we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you keep using the Site after we post changes, that counts as your acceptance of the updated Terms. We won't bury anything sneaky in here — but it's worth checking back occasionally.
