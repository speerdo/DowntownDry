          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">1. The Short Version</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Downtown Dry ("we," "our," or "us") runs the website at downtowndry.bar. This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect from you, why we collect it, and what we do with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don't sell your information. We don't do anything weird with it. We collect what we need to run our site and serve you well — that's it. Keep reading for the specifics.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">2. What We Collect</h2>
          
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3 mt-6">Stuff You Give Us Directly</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            If you fill out our contact form, we'll get your name, email, and whatever you wrote in the message. If you sign up for our newsletter, we collect your email address. And if you submit a venue for our directory, we collect the details you share about that spot.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3 mt-6">Stuff Collected Automatically</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Like most websites, we pick up some data automatically when you browse — things like what browser you're using, which pages you visit, how long you spend on them, and how you found us. We may also collect basic device info (device type, operating system, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>None of this is personally identifiable on its own. We use it to understand how people use the site so we can make it better.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-10">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">3. What We Do With Your Info</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">Short answer: only what you'd expect.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Reply to messages you send through the contact form</li>
            <li>Send you our newsletter (only if you signed up for it)</li>
            <li>Add venues you've submitted to our directory</li>
            <li>Look at aggregate usage data so we know which pages are useful and which aren't</li>
            <li>Meet any legal requirements that apply to us</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We don't sell your data to advertisers or share it with people who have nothing to do with running Downtown Dry.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">4. Third-Party Services We Rely On</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">We use a handful of outside services to keep the site working. Here's the full list:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Web3Forms</strong> handles our contact form and newsletter signups</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase</strong> hosts our database (the venue directory lives here)</li>
            <li><strong>Better Rhodes</strong> is our affiliate partner — if you click a product link and buy something, they process the sale</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Each of these services has its own privacy policy. When you interact with them (clicking an affiliate link, for example), their terms may apply in addition to ours. We'd encourage you to check their policies if you're curious.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">5. Cookies</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We may use cookies — small files stored on your device — to help the site function properly and understand how visitors use it. Some cookies may include an anonymous unique identifier.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can tell your browser to block cookies entirely. Just know that some parts of the site might not work as smoothly without them.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-10">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">6. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We take reasonable steps to keep your data safe — encrypted connections, secure hosting, and access controls on our end. That said, no system connected to the internet is completely bulletproof. We do our best, but we can't promise perfection.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">7. Your Rights</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>See what personal data we have about you</li>
            <li>Ask us to fix anything that's wrong</li>
            <li>Ask us to delete your data</li>
            <li>Unsubscribe from our emails</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent you previously gave us</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you want to do any of the above, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@downtowndry.bar" class="text-primary-700 hover:text-primary-800">hello@downtowndry.bar</a> and we'll take care of it.
          </p>

        <section class="mb-10">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">8. Age Requirement</h2>
          <p>
            Downtown Dry isn't designed for anyone under 21, and we don't knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you're a parent or guardian and think your child submitted info to us, reach out and we'll remove it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">9. Policy Updates</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            We may tweak this policy down the road. When we do, we'll update the date at the top. No bait-and-switch — if something meaningful changes, we want you to know about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Checking back here from time to time is the easiest way to stay in the loop.
